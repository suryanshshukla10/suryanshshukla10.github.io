Suryansh is a biomedical engineer by training. He completed his undergraduate degree (Bachelor of Technology - Honors) in biomedical engineering from Shri. G. S. Institute of Technology and Science, Indore, M.P. India, and master’s in biomedical engineering with focus area “Imaging and Medical Devices” from Johns Hopkins University. During his master’s he developed expertise in areas such as- software development, data science, ultrasound beamforming methods, computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning. At Johns Hopkins University he worked in collaboration with a team of surgeons, pathologist, and biomedical engineers to develop a computational method for detecting the point of invasion in a three-dimensional model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma constructed with z-stack of microscopic fluorescent images. Along with that, he also worked on enabling and verifying the interchangeability between mathematical model-based beamforming and deep learning-based beamforming of ultrasound images, and developed a software to monitor adherence to immunosuppressive drug for adolescent and young adults undergone kidney or liver transplant.

At Einstein in the department of pathology, Suryansh is a faculty at the rank of Principal staff scientist, and is working towards developing advanced computational and image analysis tools (AI, spatial, and statistical analysis tools) to evaluate and validate biomarkers for cancer metastasis.
